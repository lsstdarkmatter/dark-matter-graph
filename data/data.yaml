    label: Models
    description: >-
      A "model" is a theoretical framework describing the physical
      mechanism governing the microphysics of dark matter.  Examples:
      warm dark matter, axion dark matter, primordial black hole dark
      matter, etc.
  - key: probes
    label: Probes
    description: >-
      A "probe" is a physical prediction of how a model would produce
      an observable change in the universe that is distinguishable
      from the "standard" cold, collisionless LCDM. Examples: minimum
      subhalo mass, anomalous energy loss mechanism, halo triaxiliaty,
      etc.
  - key: measurements
    label: Measurements
    description: >-
      A "measurement" is a physical observable that can be measured to
      test a probe.  Examples: satellite galaxy luminosity function,
      galaxy-galaxy strong lensing flux anomalies, etc.
  - key: targets
    label: Targets
    description: >-
      A "target" is an astrophysical source or source class which is
      used to make a measurement.  Examples: populations of stars,
      individual galaxy clusters

      Dark matter that scatters with standard model particles and
      deposites some energy in direct detection experiments of the
      universe (at high scattering cross sections).

probes:
  - key: min_halo_mass
    label: Minimum halo mass
    description: >-
      The cold dark matter paradigm predicts that dark matter halos
      should extend to infinitely low mass. Any cutoff in the halo
      mass function would indicate a deviation from idealized cold
      dark matter.
    references: [2017ARA&A..55..343B]
  - key: subhalo_abundance
    label: Subhalo abundance
    description: >-
      The abundance -- i.e., the normalization of the dark matter
      subhalo mass function -- is predicted by numerical
      simulations. Deviations from cold, collisionless dark matter
      could alter the abundance of subhalos. (This probe is related
      to, but distinct from, the minimum halo mass.)
    references: [2017ARA&A..55..343B]
  - key: halo_density
    label: Halo density profile
    description: >-
      Numerical simulations predict that the density dark matter halos
      should be strongly centrally peaked. Flatter central density
      profiles could indicate deviations from cold collisionless dark
      matter (i.e., "core/cusp" problems).
    references: [2010AdAst2010E...5D, 2011ApJ...742...20W]
  - key: halo_triaxiality
    label: Halo triaxiality
    description: >-
      Numerical simulations predict the shape of dark matter
      halos. Deviations in the shape of observed halos (e.g., halo
      flattening, dark matter disks, etc.) would indicate some
      deviation from cold, collisionless dark matter.
    references: [2013MNRAS.430..105P,2013PhRvL.110u1302F]
  - key: macho_mass
    label: MACHO Mass Function
    description: >-
      If a significant fraction of dark matter resides in macroscopic
      compact objects then it can have measurable effects through
      gravitational lensing and the disruption of weakly bound
      gravitational systems. This macroscopic "quantization" could
      occur as the fundamental unit of dark matter (e.g., primordial
      black holes) or as a composite objects (e.g. Q-balls).  (We
      don't have a great name for this probe...)
  - key: energy_loss
    label: Anomalous energy loss
    description: >-
      If dark matter is composed of a light and weakly-interacting
      particle, then it could escape from stellar interiors carrying
      thermal energy. This anomalous energy loss mechanism would lead
      to observable changes in the evolution of stars.

measurements:
  - key: sat_lum_fn
    label: Satellite luminosity function
    description: >- 
      The satellite galaxy luminosity function is sensitive to the
      abundance of low-mass dark matter halos. LSST will be able to
      detect the faintest known satellites out to the virial radius of
      the Milky Way. In addition, it will be sensitive to the
      satellite populations of other nearby galaxies.

  - key: stream_gaps
    label: Gaps in stellar streams
    description: >-
      Stellar streams from tidally disrupted star clusters and
      galaxies are extremely sensitive to gravitational
      perturbations. Gravitational interactions with dark matter
      subhalos can create gaps in stellar streams which could be
      detectable by LSST. LSST will detect and measure stellar streams
      at much larger radii.

  - key: flux_ratio
    label: Strong lens flux ratio anomalies
    description: >-
      Low mass dark matter halos in lensing galaxies can cause
      anamolous flux ratios in the images of multiply-lensed
      background sources. Through lense mass modeling, it may be
      possible to use these anomalies to probe dark matter
      substructures in the intervening lens. LSST will discover
      multiple strong lenses and will monitor them for time
      variability (variable background sources can also manifest as
      flux ratio anomalies).
    references: [2002ApJ...572...25D]
  - key: stream_orbits
    label: Stellar stream orbits
    description: >-
      The orbits of stellar streams are a precise tracer of the smooth
      gravitational field of the Milky Way. By modeling the orbits of
      streams it is possible to probe the density profile and
      triaxiality of the Milky Way dark matter halo.

  - key: galaxy_sl
    label: Galaxy-galaxy strong lensing
    description: >-
      Lens mass modeling from strong lensing arcs can be used to probe
      the distribution of substructure in a small annulus around the
      Einstein radius of the lens. This can be used to statistically
      constrain the abundance of dark matter substructure. LSST will
      find strongly lensed arcs suitable for this study.

      the inner dark matter density profile.
    references: [2004ApJ...604...88S]
  - key: cluster_wl
    label: Cluster weak lens modeling
    description: >-
      Weak lensing can be used to measure the density profile and
      triaxiality of dark matter halos galaxy clusters and
      groups. LSST will produce a large area, high quality weak
      lensing shear map as well as a catalog of galaxy clusters.
  - key: wl_shear
    label: Position-shear correlation
    description: >-
      Cross-correlation of the shear field with the galaxy density
      field. (Can someone add content about how this probes
      fundamental characteristics of dark matter?)
  - key: microlens
    label: Stellar microlensing
    description: >-
      Gravitational lensing from compact dark matter can cause an
      achromatic brightening and dimming of a background star. LSST
      will be able to measure the lightcurves of billions of stars
      over long time windows. The use of micorlensing parallax will
      increase the sensitivity to ultra-long duration events.

      dark matter halos.

  - key: wdlf
    label: White dwarf luminosity function
    description: >-
      Anomalous cooling mechanisms would produce a measurable change
      in the luminosity function of white dwarf stars. LSST will be
      able to detect faint white dwarfs through color cuts and proper
      motions.
    references: [2006AJ....131..571H,2008ApJ...682L.109I]
  - key: rgb
    label: Red Giant Branch Populations
    description: >-
      Anomalous cooling mechanisms would alter stellar evolution to
      decrease the time that stars spend in the red giant branch
      (RGB). LSST could measure the relative abudances of RGB stars
      and stars in other evolutionary phases in resolved stellar
      systems.

  - key: wide_binary
    label: Population of wide-binary stars
    description: >-
      Wide-binary stars are very loosly bound systems, and hence the
      lifetime and abundance of these systems is sensitive to the
      abundance of massive compact perturbers. Will LSST should be
      able to find candidate wide-binaries through color magnitude
      cuts?

    followup: spectroscopy
  - key: cluster_centroid
    label: Cluster centroid offsets
    description: >-
      Colliding clusters offer an opportunity to measure offsets
      between the dark matter and visible centroids. Such offsets
      could result from self-interacting dark matter. LSST will find
      tens of thousands of clusters and could significantly increase
      the statistical. Measurements may be possible with LSST weak
      lensing, but it is likely that devoted optical and X-ray
      followup will be necessary.

      profile and triaxiality.

      Ultra-diffuse galaxies are underluminous for their measured dark
      matter mass. Their formation may stress stellar-mass-halo-mass
